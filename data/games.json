Your job is to collect scrap from abandoned, industrialized moons to meet the Company's profit quota. You can use the cash you earn to travel to new moons with higher risks and rewards--or you can buy fancy suits and decorations for your ship. Experience nature, scanning any creature you find to add them to your bestiary. Explore the wondrous outdoors and rummage through their derelict, steel and concrete underbellies. Just never miss the quota. ![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1966720/extras/bridgeGif.gif?t=1723894859) ![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1966720/extras/StorepageHeader2.gif?t=1723894859) These dangers prey upon the vulnerable and lonesome, and the protection of your crew may be your only hope. You can guide your crewmates from your ship, using the radar to call out traps and using the ship's terminal to access remotely locked doors--or you can all go in together.

This is Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6.\n\nDeveloped by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops.\n\nThe Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity.\n\nIn a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, players will test their skills across 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.\n\nBlack Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps. With additional content still to come, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.\n\nAI Generated Content Disclosure\nThe developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:\n\nOur team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.\n\nMature Content Description\nThe developers describe the content like this:\n\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.",

Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Next_Gen_new.gif?t=1740386911)\nForged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a thriving world filled with characters, dangers, and deceit. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before. From shadow-cursed forests, to the magical caverns of the Underdark, to the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate itself, your actions define the adventure, but your choices define your legacy. You will be remembered.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Experience_Depth.png?t=1740386911)\nThe Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed, and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you – verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of Baldur’s Gate. Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same. ![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/01_Bullets_points.png?t=1740386911)\nCombat allows you to combine your forces in battle and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas. Concoct the perfect plan together… or introduce an element of chaos when your friends least expect it. Relationships are complicated. Especially when you’ve got a parasite in your brain.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/02_Bullets_points.png?t=1740386911)\nSeven unique Origin heroes offer a hand-crafted experience, each with their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you. ![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/03_Bullets_points.png?t=1740386911)\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is based on the D&D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage and disadvantage, and roll modifiers join an advanced AI, expanded environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that rewards strategy and foresight. Three difficulty settings allow you to customize the challenge of combat. Enable weighted dice to help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore experience.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/04_Bullets_points_Unprecedented.png?t=1740386911)\nThe game features 31 subraces on top of the 11 main races (Human, Githyanki, Half-Orc, Dwarf, Elf, Drow, Tiefling, Halfling, Half-Elf, Gnome, Dragonborn), with 46 subclasses branching out of the 12 classes. Over 600 spells and actions offer near-limitless freedom of interactivity in a hand-crafted world where exploration is rewarded, and player agency defines the journey. The unique Character Creator features unprecedented depth, ensuring that whomever you are, you will leave a unique legacy behind you, all the way up to Level 12. Over 174 hours of cinematics ensure that no matter the choices you make, the cinematic experience follows your journey – every playthrough, a new cinematic adventure.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/05_Bullets_points_Romances.png?t=1740386911)\nWith the looming threat of war heading to Baldur’s Gate, and a mind flayer invasion on the horizon, friendships – though not necessary – are bound to be forged on your journey. What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/06_Bullets_points_Customise.png?t=1740386911)\nBaldur’s Gate 3 provides three different levels of streamer-friendly customization. You can disable nudity and explicit content separately (or together), and you can enable Twitch integration to interact directly with your audience. You’ll be able to stream Baldur’s Gate 3 without any problems, regardless of how you play, thanks to these options. ![Alt Text](https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Final_Image_new.gif?t=17403869111)",
